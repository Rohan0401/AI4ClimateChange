# AI4ClimateChange
This repository is intended to create a practical solution for the climate change problem. The readme is in progress and will be updated soon. 

## Project Objective 
Currently, there are many ways climate change can be tackled the most interested are controlling pollution and optimization. There are various ways by which we can approach these issues, so we would like to further narrow it down to air pollution and energy efficiency.
