# AI4ClimateChange
This repository is intended to create a practical solution for the climate change problem. The readme is in progress and will be updated soon. 

## Project Objective 
Currently, there are many ways climate change can be tackled the most interested are controlling pollution and optimization. There are various ways by which we can approach these issues, so we would like to further narrow it down to air pollution and energy efficiency.

### Air Pollution 
Air pollution is one of the top contributors to climate change, the ongoing fossil fuel-based technologies are not going to be replaced soon and will lead to devastating effects on our environment. Greenhouse gases are unstoppable now and they will be continuously increasing in the future. There is a great scope for AI to properly model and reduce air pollution using various historical and sensors online data to model and reduce air pollution. 

### Optimization 
Energy optimization is another area where AI systems can help, reducing energy leakage and improving the efficiency of the current power system will provide great benefit to fight with Climate Change. Energy preservation can also be one of the important aspects of this problem.

## Project Objective 
Currently there are many ways climate change can be tackled the one I am most
